  <h3>Godot Visualizations</h3>
  <a href="https://yidan-zhu.github.io/upload-html/"> 1D Gaussian </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>    This is a 1D Gaussian visualization, with three types of on-screen input methods - sliders, joystick, and finger-touch.
     If you put a finger in the axis region, the Gaussian peak will go to that event-position and two Gaussian parameters - mean and std-deviation - change automatically.</p>

  <h3>Unity Visualizations</h3>
  <a href="https://yidan-zhu.github.io/html_upload_2/"> Head-direction Neurons </a>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>    This is a visualization of head-direction neurons. The neurons align in a circle biologically. 
     They will change activity when head faces different directions, and 
     tend to have higher activity along a specific orientation. </p>
